# Rag-Project
This project is a Streamlit-based RAG chatbot that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and interactively ask questions based on their content. It uses LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and Groqâ€™s LLMs (like LLaMA3) for efficient document retrieval and natural language understanding.
